    "#### A few key points:\n",
    "* Ryu does not natively know or care about what you do with a packet.\n",
    "* All it needs to know is the output port in which to send the packet.\n",
    "* Ryu does not know about internet protocols like ARP, IP, MAC forwarding etc. It does exactly what you ask it to.\n",
    "* Ryu is an OpenFlow controller which is designed to run on a seperate server and usually knows the entire topology. (Think of a cluster of network switches and Ryu as the orchestrator that knows everything)\n",
    "* Therefore, every variable you define in Ryu controller is common for every Switch. \n",
    "* But OpenFlow also provides a flow table that is unique to every switch which has to be populated for every switch with match-action pairs.\n",
    "* Everytime a switch receives a packet, it will first check its flow table for any matching entries. Otherwise, it simply sends the packet to the controller.\n",
    "* Ryu and Mininet work only on Linux."
