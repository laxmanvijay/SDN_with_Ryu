    "Before continuing with the implementation, here's a quick summary of IP routing:\n",
    "* Suppose you initiate a ping request in a host.\n",
    "* If the destination is in the same subnet, it directly sends it to the destination.\n",
    "* Otherwise, it sends it to the gateway router. \n",
    "* The IP address of the destination/gateway router is already known using protocols like DNS/DHCP.\n",
    "* The host then constructs the IP packet with the appropriate src and dst ip addresses.\n",
    "* Now it needs to construct the ethernet frame to send it over the wire.\n",
    "* In order to construct a ethernet frame, the host needs the destination mac address.\n",
    "* It checks its arp cache to see if it exists. If not, ARP broadcast request (destination mac is set to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF and destination ip is set to the target ip) is sent to discover the mac address of the destination. The host also includes its own mac address in the request.\n",
    "* Once the gateway router/destination host receives an arp request with broadcast request, it checks the destination IP and if it matches its own IP, a unicast response with the actual mac address is sent back.\n",
    "* Now the host can construct an ethernet frame with proper mac.\n",
